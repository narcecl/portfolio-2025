I led the development of the bank's new public website in the Digital Channels team. I created and optimized a component library in Vue, including its documentation for the development team. Additionally, I collaborated on new initiatives and developments. Among my key contributions, I developed a cross-accessibility component that allowed for applying black-and-white filters, high contrast, and adjusting font size, improving digital inclusion.
