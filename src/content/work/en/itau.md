I led the development and optimization of the Design System in React, ensuring its efficiency and scalability. Among my key contributions, I standardized the development of the bank's components by building four libraries, which allowed for greater consistency and standardization across different projects. I was also responsible for the technical documentation for the development teams and collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to improve user experience and accessibility.
